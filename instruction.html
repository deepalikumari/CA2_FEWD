    <p><i>Follow these rules and instructions to enjoy a challenging and entertaining game of Hangman on your computer or mobile device!</i></p>

    <h1>Rules:</h1><br>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Word Selection:</strong> The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list or category.</li>
        <li><strong>Hangman Figure:</strong> An empty gallows is displayed, representing the hangman. It has spaces for the head, body, arms, and legs.</li>
        <li><strong>Guessing Letters:</strong> Players guess letters of the alphabet one at a time, trying to figure out the secret word.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Guesses:</strong> For each incorrect guess, a body part of the hangman is drawn. The sequence typically starts with the head, then the body, arms, and legs.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Guesses:</strong> Players have a limited number of guesses (6) before the hangman is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning or Losing:</strong> The game ends when the players guess the word correctly before the hangman is complete. If the hangman is fully drawn before guessing the word, the player loses.</li>
    </ol>
